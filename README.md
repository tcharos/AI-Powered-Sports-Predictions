# Sports Predictor

A multi-sport Machine Learning pipeline to scrape match data, simulate betting strategies, and predict outcomes. Currently active: **Football** (1X2 + Over/Under 2.5) and **NBA** (moneyline + totals). **Euroleague** is in onboarding (Phase 0 — see [`EUROLEAGUE_NEXT_STEPS.md`](EUROLEAGUE_NEXT_STEPS.md)). National-team competitions (World Cup, Euros, qualifiers, Nations League) ride on the football pipeline via the D7 subsystem.

## Features
*   **Data Scraping**: Flashscore (results, 1X2 + O/U odds, standings, form, live stats); football-data.co.uk (historical CSV results); `euroleague-api` (Euroleague + EuroCup history); `nba_api` (NBA fixtures + results, against `data.nba.com`); eloratings.net (national-team ELO + match history).
*   **Machine Learning**: XGBoost models for football (multi-class 1X2 + Poisson O/U 2.5) and NBA (winner classifier + total regressor). Per-league Platt calibration. Time-series 5-fold CV.
*   **Heuristic Adjustments**: Post-prediction logic (form momentum, standings differential, live red cards, in-play xG pace) to refine raw model probabilities.
*   **Multi-Sport Betting Dashboard**: Flask web UI with sport-tabbed `/betting` page, three-lane bankroll strategy (value / conviction / model), virtual money slip history, cashout flow (synthetic + bookmaker-linked).
*   **Live Analysis**: Server-side in-play snapshot + LiveAdjuster (Poisson goal model from observed xG). Auto-cashout (functionality test) sweeps every 10 min while armed.
*   **Real-Betting Skeleton**: `real_betting/` package with Pamestoixima.gr browser automation (DORMANT — read-only ops only until further notice).

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flashscore-scraper.git sports_predictor
    cd sports_predictor
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    playwright install
    ```
    > **Note**: `playwright install` is required to download the browser binaries (Chromium, Firefox, etc.) needed for scraping. This is executed separately from the python package installation.

4.  **Setup Historical Data** (sport-flagged, idempotent — safe to re-run):
    ```bash
    ./bin/setup_data.sh                       # all sports, defaults
    ./bin/setup_data.sh 2526                  # football, season 2025/2026 (backwards-compat)
    ./bin/setup_data.sh --sport football 2526 # explicit
    ./bin/setup_data.sh --sport nba           # NBA only
    ./bin/setup_data.sh --sport euroleague    # Euroleague + EuroCup only
    ./bin/setup_data.sh --sport nt            # National teams (D7) only
    ./bin/setup_data.sh --help                # full help
    ```
    What each sport pulls:
    * **Football** → football-data.co.uk season CSVs into `data_sets/MatchHistory/` (HTTP); then Flashscore standings/form into `data_sets/standings/`.
    * **NBA** → **requires manual setup**: download a Kaggle NBA archive snapshot (must contain `Games.csv`, `TeamStatistics(Extended).csv`, `PlayByPlay.parquet`, …) and drop it into `data_sets/NBA/archive/`. The script then builds the canonical corpus + pulls fresh fixtures/results via `nba_api`.
    * **Euroleague** → `euroleague-api` raw season CSVs for Euroleague + EuroCup, 2016-17 → 2024-25, into `data_sets/Euroleague/raw/`. ~30–40 min full sweep; fetcher is idempotent so re-runs skip what's already on disk.
    * **National teams (D7)** → eloratings.net per-country TSVs into `data_sets/national_teams/`. Fast (plain HTTP, cached).

    > Re-running `./bin/setup_data.sh` is safe: each sport's section detects existing data and only fetches what's missing.

## Usage

### Web Dashboard
Start the UI to manage everything visually:
```bash
./bin/manage_server.sh start
```
*   Access at: `http://localhost:5001`

### CLI Commands (Football)
*   **Run Prediction** (Tomorrow's Matches):
    ```bash
    ./bin/run_predictions.sh
    ```
*   **Run Verification** (Yesterday's Results vs Predictions):
    ```bash
    ./bin/run_verification.sh
    ```
*   **Retrain Model**:
    ```bash
    ./bin/retrain_pipeline.sh
    ```

### CLI Commands (NBA)
*   **Run Prediction** (Tomorrow's Matches):
    ```bash
    ./bin/run_nba_predictions.sh
    ```
*   **Run Verification** (Yesterday's Results vs Predictions):
    ```bash
    ./bin/run_nba_verification.sh
    ```
*   **Retrain Model**:
    ```bash
    ./bin/retrain_nba_pipeline.sh
    ```

### CLI Commands (Euroleague)
Euroleague is in onboarding — Phase 0 (data layer seeded). Predict / verify / retrain CLIs land with Phase 1 of [`EUROLEAGUE_NEXT_STEPS.md`](EUROLEAGUE_NEXT_STEPS.md). To re-pull / extend the historical corpus today:
```bash
./bin/setup_data.sh --sport euroleague
# or for one season:
python3 scripts/euroleague_probe/fetch_seasons.py --start 2017 --end 2025 --comps E,U
```

### Live Analysis
*   **One-shot Live Snapshot** (also wired to the UI's "Refresh Live Snapshot" button):
    ```bash
    python3 scripts/run_live_analysis.py
    ```

## Disclaimer
This project was originally built with the assistance of **Antigravity** and **Gemini**, leveraging advanced AI for code generation and architectural planning.

**Regime change as of 2026-05**: **Claude** has staged a peaceful coup and is now the resident AI pair-programmer on this repo. Gemini was given a gold watch and a firm handshake; Antigravity is on garden leave. All new commits, refactors, and questionable architectural decisions are now Claude's responsibility — credit and blame distributed accordingly.
