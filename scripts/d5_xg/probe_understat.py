"""D5 / gate-2(ii) — Understat historical-xG probe (READ-ONLY, reproducible).

Scopes the "historical xG as a TRAINING feature" test — the one signal the D2
arc flagged as *maybe* not market-priced-dead (we use xG live but never in
training). Understat is chosen over FBref for this: plain HTTP (no Selenium /
Cloudflare — discreet, fast), xG-native, and the reference xG dataset.

FINDINGS (2026-05-27) — see NEXT_STEPS "D5 → gate-2(ii)":
  * DATA SHAPE: `Understat.read_schedule()` already carries match-level
    `home_xg` / `away_xg` next to `date, home_team, away_team, home_goals,
    away_goals, is_result` — the whole signal in ONE plain-HTTP call per
    league-season. No need for the heavier `read_team_match_stats`.
  * COVERAGE: Big-5 only (ENG/ESP/GER/ITA/FRA Premier divisions) + RFPL on the
    site — i.e. the MOST efficient markets, the opposite of where D2 says the
    edge lives. xG window ~2014/15+, so the feature is NaN for the 2010-2014
    slice of our MatchHistory corpus → the clean OOF test is the Big-5, 2014+
    subset (XGBoost tolerates NaN, but isolate to measure xG's contribution).
  * JOIN CRUX: Understat full official names ("Manchester City", "Nottingham
    Forest", "Wolverhampton Wanderers") vs our football-data corpus short names
    ("Man City", "Nott'm Forest", "Wolves"). Within-league WRatio + a small
    override map (the D6 lesson: keep the join within-league to avoid the
    cross-league false matches that sank a naive global fuzzy). This probe
    reports the live match rate.
  * PRIOR: low. D2 (cheap features dead) + D6 (a 2nd ELO source added nothing)
    say more tabular signal rarely moves Brier; the honest expectation is this
    closes like D6. But it's the one untested "maybe" and Understat makes the
    test cheap — so run it, don't assume.
